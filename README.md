UVM Fundamentals code challenge Starting from May - 2023

WELCOME TO MY 100 DAYS OF SV(UVM)
My Name is Sathvik S, I mostly use Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and sometimes Modelsim and Eda playground software for the simulation of RTL Codes. And The Synthesis is performed by using Intel Quartus Prime Software.

Passionate about Semiconductor design and verification with practical expertise using Xilinx Vivado and other EDA tools. Looking for an opportunity in the semiconductor industry to work on innovative projects and collaborate with experts and continue learning.

This repository contains sample snippets of code that illustrate UVM concepts.

I have started my journey of learning UVM Fundamentals from Kumar Khandagle (udemy).
